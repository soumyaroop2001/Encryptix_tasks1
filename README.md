# Encryptix_tasks1
We'll use Python with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for this task.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

Load the dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a machine learning model.
Evaluate the model.
The dataset contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger name
Sex: Passenger sex
Age: Passenger age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
There are some missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns. We'll handle these missing values and preprocess the data before building the model.
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 82.12% on the test set.
Data visualization helps to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. Let's create some visualizations to explore the Titanic dataset.

We'll use libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create the following visualizations:

Distribution of Age
Survival rate by Sex
Survival rate by Passenger Class (Pclass)
Survival rate by Embarkation Port (Embarked)
It seems there was an issue generating the visualizations directly. Let's break down the code and ensure it works as expected by executing each part step by step.
et's save the generated plots as image files and then provide links to download them.
It seems there are issues with saving the plots as well. Let's troubleshoot by checking the steps to ensure the environment is set up correctly.

Let's check if we can create and save a simple plot without using the Titanic dataset to isolate the issue.
It seems like I canâ€™t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.
